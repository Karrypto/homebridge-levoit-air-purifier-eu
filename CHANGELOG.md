All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.5] - 2024-12-19

### Fixed
- Changelog now visible in Homebridge UI update dialog (added changelog field to package.json)

## [1.0.4] - 2024-12-19

### Fixed
- **Prevent "new device" login emails**: Device IDs (terminalId, appId) are now persisted and reused across logins, so VeSync recognizes the plugin as the same device
- **Fix undefined characteristic values**: Use nullish coalescing (??) instead of logical OR (||) to prevent undefined values when device properties are false
- **Active characteristic**: Always returns 0 or 1, never undefined
